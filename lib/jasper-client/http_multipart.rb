# A mixin to add basic RFC 2387 MIME Multipart/Related
# response support. 
#
# A multipart http response has several sections which are
# intended to be treated as indpendent objects.  The
# Multipart/Related response is used when all of the objects
# are related to one another.  Typcially multipart is used
# to have alternative versions of the same content. This is
# not the case with multipart related.
#
# This mixen was written while using the Savon SOAP API, but 
# it's intended to be mixed in to Net::HTTP and does not have
# any known dependencies on Savon.
